  Place(title: "CAFE HAFA", description: "Cafe Hafa is practically an institution of historical Tangier and is a must-see for anyone passing through. It has existed since 1921, as it so proudly proclaims at its entrance, and resides on a cliffside with a stunning panorama of the Mediterranean sea."),
  Place(title: "PHOENICIAN TOMBS", description: "The Phoenician tombs are located between Cafe Hafa and the top entrance to the Old Kasbah. It’s true that these tomb structures are very often filled with water and litter, but they are still interesting and of great historic value."),
  Place(title: "GET LOST IN THE OLD KASBAH", description: "Getting lost in the old city is an absolute must when visiting Tangier! What is so interesting about the old medina is the miles and miles of tiny, narrow, endless paths in between the buildings where one can get lost in no time."),
  Place(title: "KASBAH MUSEUM", description: "When I, Ruby, first saw the Kasbah Museum, it was not as a curious tourist, but as a choreographer holding rehearsals in the open building behind the museum’s gardens."),
  Place(title: "PETIT SOCCO", description: "Right in between the hike from the Grand Socco to the port, you will come across a smaller square, lined with a few cafes and several shops and galleries."),
  Place(title: "AMERICAN LEGATION", description: "The American Legation is a museum, cultural center, and research library that holds historical and artistic artifacts and is home to a rich history of diplomatic relations between the United States and Morocco."),
  Place(title: "THE GRAND SOCCO & CINEMA RIF", description: "The Grand Socco goes by a few different names- Souk Ibarra, if you’re a local, but it is officially called Place du Grand 9 Avril 1947 after a famous speech given by King Mohammed V in support of Moroccan independence on, of course, April 9, 1947."),
  Place(title: "MARKETS IN TANGIER", description: "Like any other city in Morocco, Tangier also has a few colorful souks (markets) that are a pleasure for the eye and nose to visit."),
  Place(title: "ST. ANDREW’S CHURCH", description: "Visiting an Anglican church in Tangier, Morocco may sound a bit out-of-the-ordinary, but St. Andrew’s is a beautiful, historic sort of sanctuary in the middle of the bustling city."),
